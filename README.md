Next JS


**TO DO**

Add global state with XState, since static data is retrieved from the API a few times, such as in Home and Search pages.

When changing the viewport size, there may be fonts overlapping. Define each breakpoint font-size in tailwind.config.js

Keep code DRY. There is a function called callApi, which can be put in a separate file and then imported

The url is set to localhost:3000. Define var in package.json for building for production and running on dev.

Write in TypeScript.

Comment thoroughly throughout code.
